# Contributing to Spec-First

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Project Status

Spec-First is early-stage and intentionally small. The goal is a minimal, opinionated starter—not a feature-rich framework.

## Before You Start

**Open an issue first** before submitting major changes. This helps us discuss whether the change fits the project's goals and avoid wasted effort.

Small fixes (typos, broken links, clarifications) can go straight to a PR.

## Guidelines

- **Keep examples small and readable** — Demos should be understandable in a few minutes
- **Follow the spec-first workflow** — When adding new demos, write the spec first, then tests, then code
- **Stay minimal** — If something can be left out, leave it out
- **Use plain language** — Avoid jargon in docs and specs

## What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes and typo corrections
- Improvements to documentation clarity
- Additional cheat sheet examples
- Translations (if there's demand)

## What We're Not Looking For (Yet)

- Major new features or tooling
- Framework integrations
- Language-specific ports (though you're welcome to fork and adapt)

## Questions?

Open an issue. We're happy to help.
