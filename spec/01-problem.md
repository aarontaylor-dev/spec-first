# Problem Statement

> **Template**: Replace the placeholder sections below with your project's problem statement. See the Counter Demo at the bottom for an example.

## The Problem

<!-- TODO: Describe the problem in 2-3 sentences. Be specific about the pain. -->

Users need a way to **[do something specific]**. Currently, they **[describe the current painful approach]**. This causes **[describe the negative impact]**.

## Who has this problem?

<!-- TODO: List the user types affected -->

- **[User Type 1]** — [How they experience the problem]
- **[User Type 2]** — [How they experience the problem]

## Why it matters

<!-- TODO: Why is this worth solving? -->

- [Business or user impact 1]
- [Business or user impact 2]

## Success criteria

<!-- TODO: How will we know we solved it? Make these measurable. -->

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]

## Counter Demo

> This example shows how a filled-in problem statement looks. Delete this section when adding your own.

**The Problem**: Developers need a simple example to understand spec-first development. Currently, they read abstract explanations without seeing the workflow in action. This makes adoption harder.

**Who has this problem**:
- **Developers new to spec-first** — They understand the theory but not the practice

**Why it matters**:
- Without a concrete example, the methodology stays abstract
- Developers won't adopt workflows they can't visualize

**Success criteria**:
- [ ] Counter can be incremented, decremented, and reset
- [ ] Tests mirror the behaviour specification
- [ ] Code is minimal and matches the spec exactly
