# Scope

> **Template**: Replace the placeholder sections below with your project's scope. See the Counter Demo at the bottom for an example.

## In Scope

<!-- TODO: What we WILL build. Be specific. -->

- [Feature or capability 1]
- [Feature or capability 2]
- [Feature or capability 3]

## Out of Scope

<!-- TODO: What we explicitly WON'T build. This prevents scope creep. -->

- [Excluded thing 1]
- [Excluded thing 2]

## Constraints

<!-- TODO: Technical, business, or regulatory constraints -->

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Assumptions

<!-- TODO: Things we're assuming to be true -->

- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

## Counter Demo

> This example shows how a filled-in scope looks. Delete this section when adding your own.

**In Scope**:
- Increment counter by 1
- Decrement counter by 1
- Reset counter to 0
- Get current value

**Out of Scope**:
- Persistence (counter resets when app restarts)
- Increment/decrement by arbitrary amounts
- Multiple independent counters
- Undo/redo history

**Constraints**:
- Counter value must be an integer
- No external dependencies

**Assumptions**:
- Single-threaded usage (no concurrency handling needed)
